It is a wonderfull book. The story is amazing. I was very sad on the moment he was bullied.  And it makes me happy to see August with his friends. I think that the author palacio did a great job.

I had a good first impression, but when I started reading the book, I found it annoying that another character always said something. The story it self is impressive and intense. I recommend this book because it is good to read a book in a different language and it is a good story.

Hello I'm Jens, what I found about this book is. The way it's wrote is fantastic and the story is beautiful but after a couple of pages I found it little bit boring. But the story and the meaning is nice.
